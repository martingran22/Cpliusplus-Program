The goal of this project was to create a code that will show the benefits of investing and the affect that interest can have on it. This is a great way to show kids the concepts of financial responsibility. 
One of the things that I did very well, was creating a clean readable code that does what it was intended to do.
I believe there are different ways to create that code that I created. There are probably other methods that could have been chosen to my the code more concise. 
One of the hardest things that I alwasy finish is starting off the code. I alwasy struggle on how to start it and waht methods I want to use. I use the school material along with youtube videos to change my code. Once I get the basics of my code, I look at ways on how to make it more concise and readable. 
One of the skills that I used for this assignment and class, was looking over my code then next and looking at ways to improve it. Even though the code did what I wanted it to do, I would try and finds ways to make it more concise.
I tried to write concise code and I wrote comments where needed to make it readable and adatable.
